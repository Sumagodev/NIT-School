                                    Through my last 36 years of experience in
                                    various sectors like
                                    industrial, construction, banking, social,
                                    etc., I strongly believe
                                    that there is still a long way to go to
                                    attain the increasing demand of
                                    technology-savvy minds by the industrial
                                    sector. For that, the excellence
                                    in education and training is the need of the
                                    hour. NIT â€“ Nasik Institute
                                    of Technology is taking shape to bridge the
                                    gap between the future demand
                                    and supply of technical human resources.
                                    Over the year, it will grow into
                                    a leading educational center in Maharashtra,
                                    widely recognized for its
                                    modern state-of-the-art infrastructure,
                                    vibrant campus, and academic
                                    excellence in the field of technical
                                    education. The courses designed are
                                    amongst the best in the industry and are
                                    believed to equip students with
                                    effective knowledge, potentials, insights,
                                    and expertise so that they can
                                    make a successful and bright career. Keeping
                                    in mind the requirement of
                                    the building construction industry, we have
                                    designed a sandwich course in
                                    Civil Engineering to give in-depth knowledge
                                    of on-site working. We trust
                                    the fact that if youth is equipped with
                                    proper knowledge and skills, they
                                    can be the most powerful global asset. We
                                    are proud to say that we are
                                    creating youth anium (Intellectual Youth
